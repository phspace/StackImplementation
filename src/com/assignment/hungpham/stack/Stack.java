//#Hung: @Carl: I am really sorry about this, it's a big mig mistake, and I fix it now.

//#Carl: The class name violates coding convention ï¿½45: class names are nouns in singular form.
//#Hung: @Carl: I changed it, thank you.

//#Evelin: This stack implemenatation in not type safe! If we push Strings and Numbers mixed in one stack, there may be type errors when pop-ing the from the stack. 
//#Hung: @Evelin: I am sorry. Because @Tom just asked me to write a stack of Objects in the assignment requirements so I just used the superclass Object for all types.
//#Hung: I changed a little bit in my code, so the implementation can be type safe or not, which depends on the user's requirement.

//#Ralf: It is possible to use this stack without a type cast?
//#Hung: @Ralf: I think yes. Integer or Double or String can be pushed directly to the stack because of the auto-boxing.
